## Overview

The attribution engine answers the fundamental question for HVAC agencies: **"Which marketing dollars produced which revenue?"**

It does this by:

1. **Ingesting** marketing touchpoints (clicks, calls, form fills) as attribution events
2. **Detecting** PII and form structure automatically using adaptive field detection
3. **Normalizing** lead sources and funnels via alias resolution
4. **Syncing** completed jobs and invoices from ServiceTitan
5. **Matching** attribution events to jobs using a confidence-tiered waterfall
6. **Reporting** attributed revenue back to the ad platforms and the agency dashboard

## Integration Sync Pipeline

The sync pipeline runs on scheduled intervals, pulling data from external platforms into the local database. Each sync run is logged in the `integration_sync_logs` table with its type, status, and record count.

### ServiceTitan

| Sync Type | Interval | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| `jobs` | 15 minutes | Fetches completed jobs, enriches customer contacts and addresses, then triggers lead matching and reconciliation |
| `invoices` | 60 minutes | Fetches recent invoices, aggregates revenue/rebates/balance, updates corresponding job records |

After jobs sync, the pipeline automatically:
- **Enriches** customer contacts (phone, email) and service addresses via separate ST API calls
- **Matches** jobs to leads using phone/email/address
- **Runs reconciliation** to link jobs to attribution events

### Google Ads

| Sync Type | Interval | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| `campaigns` | 60 minutes | Fetches campaign metadata and daily performance stats (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions) for the last 90 days |

### Meta (Facebook/Instagram)

| Sync Type | Interval | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| `campaigns` | 60 minutes | Fetches campaign insights (spend, clicks, impressions) similar to Google Ads |

---

## Attribution Events

Attribution events represent a marketing touchpoint — the moment a potential customer interacted with an ad or campaign.

### Event Sources

| Source | Method | Data Captured |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------|
| **Tracker Script** | IIFE on client website (`tracker.js`) | All UTM params (source, medium, campaign, term, content), click IDs (GCLID, FBCLID, MSCLKID, TTCLID, li_fat_id, wbraid), landing page, referrer, form fields |
| CallRail | API sync (paginated, with retry) | Caller phone number (hashed), call duration, tracking number, source/medium/campaign, GCLID |
| GHL (GoHighLevel) | Webhook | Form fields, hashed email/phone |
| Podium | Webhook | SMS/call conversations, contact data |

### Event Types

- **click** — Ad click captured by the tracker script (carries GCLID or FBCLID)
- **call** — Inbound phone call tracked via CallRail
- **form_fill** — Form submission captured via tracker script or GHL webhook

### Ingestion Endpoints

Events enter the system via two endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|:---------|:--------|:-----|
| `POST /api/tracker/submit` | Client-side tracker script submissions (forms with attribution) | Open CORS (public, keyed by `client_id` slug) |
| `POST /webhooks/ingest` | Server-side webhooks from CallRail, GHL, Podium | Replit-domain CORS only |

### Universal Form Attribution Script (`tracker.js`)

The tracker script is a self-contained IIFE served from `/tracker.js` on the API server. It replaces the earlier passive hidden-field injector with an active script that intercepts form submissions directly. It is embedded on each client's website via a single `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://{api-domain}/tracker.js" data-client-id="acme-hvac" defer></script>
```

**Capabilities:**

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **UTM Capture** | `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content` from URL params |
| **Click ID Capture** | `gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid`, `ttclid`, `li_fat_id`, `wbraid` |
| **Cookie Persistence** | Last-touch attribution cookie (`_attr_data`, 30-day TTL) + first-touch landing page cookie (`_attr_lp`) |
| **Form Interception** | Native HTML forms (`submit` event), HubSpot (`postMessage onFormSubmitted`), Gravity Forms (`gform_confirmation_loaded`), WPForms (`wpformsAjaxSubmitSuccess`), Typeform (`postMessage form-submit`) |
| **jQuery Compatibility** | Deferred jQuery detection (polls up to 10s) then binds `$(document).on(...)` for Gravity/WPForms events that are jQuery-triggered rather than native DOM events |
| **Dynamic Forms** | `MutationObserver` with `WeakSet` dedup auto-binds forms injected after page load |
| **Submission Dedup** | 3-second sliding window dedup keyed on `type|id|name` prevents double POSTs when both native submit and plugin success hooks fire for the same form |
| **Delivery** | `fetch` with `keepalive` + 2 retries (1.5s delay) → `navigator.sendBeacon` fallback (with `Blob` content-type) → `localStorage` queue (cap 10) flushed on next page load |
| **Sensitive Field Filtering** | Automatically excludes `password`, `credit_card`, `cvv`, `ssn`, and similar fields; skips `hidden` and `password` input types |
| **Heartbeat** | POST to `/api/tracker/heartbeat` every 6 hours for script health monitoring; accepts both `clientId` (slug) and legacy numeric `tenantId` |

**Script Attributes:**

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:------------|
| `data-client-id` | Yes | Tenant's `clientSlug` (e.g., `acme-hvac`) — auto-generated from tenant name, unique per tenant |
| `data-endpoint` | No | Override submit URL (defaults to same origin `/api/tracker/submit`) |
| `data-cookie-domain` | No | Cookie domain for cross-subdomain tracking |
| `data-exclude-fields` | No | JSON array of field names to exclude from capture |
| `data-capture-fields` | No | JSON array of field names to exclusively capture (allowlist mode) |
| `data-custom` | No | JSON object of custom dimensions sent with every submission |
| `data-funnel` | No | Funnel slug for lead routing — maps to a tenant's configured funnel type |
| `data-tenant` | No | Legacy numeric tenant ID (backward compat for heartbeat) |

**Payload Structure:**

Each submission POSTs this JSON to `/api/tracker/submit`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "acme-hvac",
  "submitted_at": "2026-04-08T19:00:00.000Z",
  "page_url": "https://acmehvac.com/contact",

    "utm_term": "ac repair",
    "utm_content": null,
    "gclid": "abc123",
    "fbclid": null,
    "msclkid": null,
    "ttclid": null,
    "li_fat_id": null,
    "wbraid": null
  },
  "form": {
    "id": "contact-form",
    "name": "Contact Us",
    "type": "native",
    "action": "https://acmehvac.com/submit"
  },
  "fields": {
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567",
    "service_needed": "AC Repair"
  },
  "custom": {
    "funnel": "hvac-residential"
  }
}
```

**Backend Processing (`/api/tracker/submit`):**

1. Resolves `client_id` string slug → tenant via `clientSlug` column (unique, not null)
2. Runs **auto-adaptive field detection** on form fields (see below)
3. Runs **funnel normalization** to resolve the canonical funnel (see below)
4. Creates an `attribution_event` with all UTM params, click IDs, referrer, page URL, form metadata, form fields (JSONB), `detectedMappings`, `resolvedLeadSource`, and `resolvedFunnel`
5. Pre-assigns match level: Diamond if GCLID present, Golden if phone detected, Silver if email detected
6. Hashes phone/email using the shared phone normalization utility (see below) for reconciliation matching
7. Checks **ingestion mode** — if `sheets`, stops here (event-only); if `both` or `tracker`, continues to lead creation
8. In `both` mode: runs **48-hour dedup** against existing leads (phone then email) to avoid duplicates with sheet sync
9. If PII is found and not deduplicated: creates a lead with round-robin CSR assignment, stamps `createdLeadId` on the attribution event, triggers auto-pass timer, and emits real-time Socket.IO notification

**Tenant Identification (`clientSlug`):**

Each tenant has a unique `clientSlug` stored on the tenants table. It is:
- Auto-generated from the tenant name when a tenant is created (e.g., "Acme HVAC" → `acme-hvac`)
- Collision-safe: if a slug already exists, a numeric suffix is appended (`acme-hvac-2`)
- Seeded for existing tenants via a one-time migration
- Enforced as NOT NULL with a unique index

### Phone Normalization

All phone numbers across the pipeline are normalized and hashed through a single shared utility (`phone-utils.ts`) to ensure consistent matching. This is critical because phone numbers arrive in many formats across different sources: `+15551234567` from CallRail, `(555) 123-4567` from form fills, `5551234567` from CRM webhooks.

**Normalization rules:**

1. Strip all non-digit characters
2. If the result is 11 digits starting with `1` (US country code), strip the leading `1`
3. The canonical form is always bare 10-digit US format: `5551234567`

**Hashing:**

- Phone numbers are normalized first, then hashed with SHA-256 (lowercase, trimmed)
- Email addresses are hashed with SHA-256 (lowercase, trimmed) without phone normalization
- The same utility is used in: tracker submissions, webhook ingestion, CallRail sync, reconciliation matching, attribution event lookup, and outbound conversion payloads

This centralization replaced five separate inline implementations that used inconsistent normalization rules, which previously caused phone hashes to mismatch across pipeline stages.

### CallRail Sync

CallRail calls are synced via the CallRail API v3 with full pagination and retry logic.

**Sync behavior:**

- Fetches calls from the last 7 days on each sync run
- Paginates through all available pages (250 calls per page) until the API reports no more pages
- Each API request is wrapped with exponential-backoff retry (up to 3 retries) to handle transient rate-limit or network errors
- Deduplicates by `externalId` (`callrail:{call_id}`) — if a call already exists as an attribution event, it is skipped
- Creates an attribution event for each new call with hashed phone, source/medium/campaign, GCLID (if present), and pre-assigned match level
- Creates a new lead if the caller doesn't already exist (matched by phone number)

**Sync logging:**

Every CallRail sync run is tracked in the `integration_sync_logs` table:

| Field | Value |
|:------|:------|
| `integration` | `callrail` |
| `syncType` | `calls` |
| `status` | `running` → `completed` or `error` |
| `recordsProcessed` | Number of new calls ingested |
| `errorMessage` | Error details (on failure only) |
| `startedAt` / `completedAt` | Sync duration tracking |

---

## Auto-Adaptive Field Detection

The field detection service (`field-detection.ts`) automatically identifies what each form field represents (email, phone, name, address, etc.) without requiring manual mapping. This is critical because every HVAC client's website uses different form builders with different field naming conventions.

### Three-Layer Detection

Detection runs in priority order — the first match wins:

| Layer | Source | Description |
|:------|:-------|:------------|
| **1. Saved Rules** | `field_mapping_rules` table | Admin-configured rules keyed on `(tenant_id, page_url_pattern, form_identifier, field_name)`. Supports `"*"` wildcard for form identifier to apply rules across all forms on a page. |
| **2. Value Patterns** | Regex analysis | Examines the field's actual value to detect email addresses (`@` + domain), phone numbers (digit patterns), and full names (two+ capitalized words). |
| **3. Field Name Heuristics** | Keyword matching | Matches the field name/key against known patterns: `email`, `phone`, `tel`, `first_name`, `fname`, `last_name`, `lname`, `name`, `zip`, `postal`, `city`, `state`, `street`, `address`, `appointment`, `date`, `time`, etc. |

The detection output includes:
- **`fields`**: Array of `{ fieldName, value, mapsTo }` — each form field with its detected semantic meaning (e.g., `mapsTo: "email"`)
- **`pii`**: Extracted PII object (`firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `phone`, `fullName`)
- **`addressParts`**: Extracted address components (`street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`)

The `detectedMappings` are persisted on the attribution event as JSONB for audit and correction.

### Field Mapping Rules

Rules are stored in the `field_mapping_rules` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `tenant_id` | integer | Tenant this rule belongs to |
| `page_url_pattern` | text | URL pattern to match (exact or wildcard) |
| `form_identifier` | text | Form ID or name; `"*"` matches all forms on the page |
| `field_name` | text | The form field name/key to map |
| `maps_to` | text | Semantic target (`email`, `phone`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullName`, `appointmentDate`, etc.) |

Rules are managed via:
- `GET /api/field-mapping-rules` — list rules for a tenant
- `POST /api/field-mapping-rules` — create a rule
- `DELETE /api/field-mapping-rules/:id` — delete a rule
- **Inline correction** from the Attribution page (creates rules from event context)

The rule cache is loaded on first use per tenant and invalidated on rule changes.

---

## Funnel Normalization

The funnel normalizer service (`funnel-normalizer.ts`) resolves incoming funnel identifiers to canonical funnel types. This is necessary because funnel information arrives in many forms: a `data-funnel` attribute on the script tag, a `custom.funnel` field in the payload, a URL path segment, or sometimes not at all.

### Funnel Fallback Chain

Resolution follows this priority:

1. **`custom.funnel`** — Explicit funnel slug sent in the payload's custom data
2. **Alias lookup** — The raw funnel string is checked against `funnel_aliases` for this tenant
3. **URL-path alias** — The page URL's path is checked against funnel aliases (e.g., `/fit-funnel/contact` → `fit-funnel`)
4. **Tenant default** — Falls back to the tenant's first assigned funnel type (deterministic ordering by funnel type ID)

The output includes:
- `resolvedFunnel`: The canonical funnel name (stored on the attribution event)
- `resolvedFunnelId`: The funnel type ID (used for lead creation)
- `resolvedLeadType`: The lead type derived from the funnel slug

### Funnel Aliases

Aliases are stored in the `funnel_aliases` table and map alternate names to canonical funnel types:

| Column | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `tenant_id` | integer | Tenant this alias belongs to |
| `funnel_type_id` | integer | The canonical funnel type this alias maps to |
| `alias` | text | The alternate name (e.g., `fb-funnel`, `google-landing`) |

Aliases are managed via:
- `GET /api/funnel-aliases` — list all aliases grouped by funnel type
- `POST /api/funnel-aliases` — create an alias (requires `funnelTypeId` + `alias`)
- `DELETE /api/funnel-aliases/:id` — delete an alias
- `POST /api/funnel-aliases/bulk` — bulk create aliases
- `POST /api/funnel-aliases/load-defaults` — seed default aliases for a tenant
- **Inline correction** from the Attribution page (creates aliases from event context)

The alias cache is tenant-scoped and invalidated on changes.

---

## Lead Ingestion Mode

Each tenant has a `leadIngestionMode` setting (`sheets`, `both`, or `tracker`) that controls how leads enter the system. This enables a gradual migration from Google Sheet-based lead ingestion to fully automated tracker-based ingestion.

### Mode Definitions

| Mode | Tracker Behavior | Sheet Sync Behavior |
|:-----|:----------------|:-------------------|
| **`sheets`** (default) | Creates attribution events only, no leads | Active — creates leads from sheet rows |
| **`both`** | Creates attribution events AND leads (with dedup) | Active — creates leads from sheet rows |
| **`tracker`** | Creates attribution events AND leads | Paused — `syncPaused` set to `true` on all sheet configs |

### Mode Switchover

Mode changes are:
- Restricted to `super_admin` and `agency_user` roles only
- Executed atomically in a single database transaction (mode update + sheet pause toggle + audit log insert)
- Protected by a tenant existence check (returns 404 for invalid tenants)
- Protected by a DB-level check constraint enforcing valid values (`sheets`, `both`, `tracker`)

When switching **to `tracker`**: all Google Sheet configs for the tenant are paused.
When switching **from `tracker` to `sheets` or `both`**: all Google Sheet configs are unpaused.

### Dual-Mode Deduplication

In `both` mode, the tracker checks for existing leads before creating a new one to avoid duplicates with sheet sync:

1. Fetches all leads for the tenant created within the last **48 hours**
2. Normalizes the incoming phone number (strips formatting) and checks for a match
3. If no phone match, normalizes the incoming email and checks for a match
4. If a duplicate is found, the attribution event is created but no new lead is generated

### Audit Log

All ingestion mode changes are recorded in the `ingestion_audit_log` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `tenant_id` | integer | Tenant whose mode changed |
| `previous_mode` | text | Mode before the change |
| `new_mode` | text | Mode after the change |
| `changed_by` | text | User ID or role of the actor |
| `changed_at` | timestamptz | When the change occurred |

### GTM Snippet Generation

The API provides a GTM-ready tracking snippet via `GET /api/ingestion-mode/gtm-snippet`. It returns a `<script>` tag with an absolute URL pointing to `tracker.js` and the tenant's `clientSlug` as `data-client-id`. The endpoint fails closed — if `API_BASE_URL` is not configured, it returns an error rather than generating a broken snippet.

---

## Reconciliation Engine

The reconciliation engine is the core matching process that links marketing attribution events to revenue-generating jobs. It runs automatically after every ServiceTitan jobs sync and on a 6-hour scheduled fallback.

### Lookback Window

The reconciliation engine only considers attribution events created within the last **90 days**. This prevents stale events (e.g., a form fill from a year ago) from being incorrectly matched to a recent job. The lookback is enforced on every attribution event query across all match tiers (Diamond, Golden, Silver, and Bronze).

Events older than 90 days are not deleted — they remain in the database for historical reporting — but they are excluded from the active matching pool.

### Match Levels

The engine uses a five-tier confidence waterfall. Each level represents a different strength of evidence linking a marketing touchpoint to a completed job.

| Level | Confidence | Matching Criteria |
|:------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| **Diamond** | 1.0 | Direct GCLID match — the job or a linked lead has a Google Click ID that matches an attribution event |
| **Golden** | 0.9 | Hashed phone match — the job's customer phone or a linked lead's phone (SHA-256, normalized) matches an attribution event's hashed phone |
| **Silver** | 0.8 | Hashed email match — the job's customer email or a linked lead's email (SHA-256) matches an attribution event's hashed email |
| **Bronze** | 0.6 | Address match — the job's service address (normalized) matches the billing address on an attribution event |
| **Unmatched** | 0.0 | No match found after all tiers are attempted |

### Matching Pipeline

For each completed job that is currently unmatched or has no match level set:

**Phase 1 — Direct job-level matching (no lead lookup required):**

1. **Diamond (direct GCLID)**: If the job already has a `matchedGclid`, look for an attribution event with that GCLID within the lookback window
2. **Golden (direct phone)**: If the job has a `customerPhone`, hash it via the shared phone normalization utility and search for a matching attribution event by `hashedPhone`
3. **Silver (direct email)**: If the job has a `customerEmail`, hash it and search for a matching attribution event by `hashedEmail`

**Phase 2 — Lead-based matching:**

4. **Find candidate leads**: Look up leads by the job's customer phone and email. If the job has neither phone nor email, fall back to name-based lead lookup (first name + last name). Leads found by phone/email are prioritized; name-only matching is a last resort and only used when no deterministic identifiers are available.
5. **Diamond (via lead GCLID)**: Check if any candidate lead has a `matchedGclid` that corresponds to an attribution event
6. **Golden (via lead phone)**: Hash each candidate lead's phone and search for a matching attribution event
7. **Silver (via lead email)**: Hash each candidate lead's email and search for a matching attribution event

**Phase 3 — Address matching:**

8. **Bronze**: Normalize the job's service address (abbreviations, punctuation, whitespace) and compare against all attribution events with a billing address for this tenant. There is no row cap on this query — all events with billing addresses within the lookback window are checked. A partial index on `(tenant_id, billing_address) WHERE billing_address IS NOT NULL` supports this scan.

**Phase 4 — Fallthrough:**

9. **Unmatched**: If no match is found at any tier, the job is marked `unmatched`

When a match is found, both the job and the attribution event are updated with the match level, confidence score, and linked GCLID (if applicable).

### External Conversion Sync

After matching, the engine pushes conversion data back to the ad platforms. Each push is deduplicated to prevent the same job from being uploaded more than once (see Outbound Push Deduplication below).

| Destination | Sync Type | What Gets Sent | User Identifiers |
|:------------|:----------|:---------------|:-----------------|
| Google Ads | `oci_upload` | Offline conversions for GCLID-matched jobs (Diamond tier) | GCLID |
| Google Ads | `enhanced_conversions` | Enhanced conversions for non-GCLID matches with revenue > 0 | Hashed email and/or hashed phone from linked lead |
| Meta | `capi_upload` | Conversions API events for matched jobs with GCLID | Hashed email and/or hashed phone from linked lead |
| ServiceTitan | `attribution_writeback` | Patches the `Attribution_GCLID` custom field on the job record | N/A |

**Lead resolution for outbound payloads:** When building Enhanced Conversion or Meta CAPI payloads, the system resolves the associated lead for each job using a priority chain: match by phone first, then email, then name. This ensures outbound conversion events carry actual hashed user identifiers rather than empty values.

### Outbound Push Deduplication

Each job tracks whether its conversion data has already been successfully uploaded to each external platform via timestamp columns on the `jobs` table:

| Column | Platform | Set When |
|:-------|:---------|:---------|
| `oci_uploaded_at` | Google Ads OCI | All conversions in the batch uploaded with zero errors |
| `enhanced_conversion_uploaded_at` | Google Ads Enhanced | All conversions in the batch uploaded with zero errors |
| `capi_uploaded_at` | Meta CAPI | All events in the batch were accepted (events received = events sent) |

**Key behaviors:**

- Before each outbound push, jobs with an existing upload timestamp for that platform are filtered out
- Upload timestamps are only set on **confirmed full-batch success** — if the API reports any partial failures or errors, no timestamps are set, and those jobs will be retried on the next reconciliation run
- This all-or-nothing approach prevents the scenario where a failed push permanently suppresses retries
- Each outbound push (success or failure) is logged in `integration_sync_logs` with record counts, error messages, and timing

---

## Data Privacy & PII Purge

ServiceTitan data often contains personally identifiable information (PII). The platform implements a data retention policy via the `st-data-purge` service.

**How it works:**

- Runs every 60 minutes
- Identifies jobs where `stDataExpiresAt` has passed (default: 24 hours after sync)
- **Redacts**: Sets `customerName`, `customerPhone`, `customerEmail`, `serviceAddress`, and raw `stJobId` to null
- **Preserves**: Retains the hashed job ID (`stJobIdHash`) and non-PII data (revenue, status, job type) for long-term reporting

This ensures the platform can report on revenue attribution without retaining sensitive customer data beyond the matching window.

The purge process logs its activity as `st_data_purge` sync type entries. These are separated from regular sync activity in the status UI to avoid confusion with failed syncs.

## Integration Status Monitoring

The internal admin dashboard provides real-time visibility into integration health via the `/integrations/sync-status` endpoint.

### Integration States

Each integration displays one of six states with clear visual indicators:

| State | Indicator | Meaning |
|:------|:----------|:--------|
| **Syncing** | Blue spinner | A data sync is currently in progress |
| **Paused** | Amber clock | Integration syncing is temporarily disabled (e.g., during migration or maintenance) |
| **Healthy** | Green check | Last sync completed successfully |
| **Error** | Red X | Last sync failed — check error details |
| **No Credentials** | Amber warning | Tenant has not configured API keys for this integration |
| **Never Synced** | Gray text | No sync has ever been attempted for this integration |

State precedence (highest to lowest): Running > Paused > No Credentials > Error > Healthy > Never

### Sync Type Breakdown

Each integration card displays a per-sync-type breakdown showing:

- **Status dot** (green/red/amber) for the most recent run of each type
- **Record count** from the last sync
- **Last run date** for operational visibility

Maintenance activities (PII purge, conversion uploads, attribution writebacks) are displayed separately from primary data syncs to keep the status view focused on data freshness.

## Attribution Page UI

The Attribution page (`attribution.tsx`) provides a full operational view of all attribution events with filtering, inline correction, and system health monitoring.

### Filters

| Filter | Options |
|:-------|:--------|
| Event Type | click, call, form_fill |
| Match Level | diamond, golden, silver, bronze, unmatched |
| Source | All detected/resolved sources |
| Funnel | All resolved funnels |
| Date Range | Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days |
| Text Search | Searches across source, funnel, page URL, form fields |

### Event Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Time | Event creation timestamp |
| Type | Event type (click/call/form fill) |
| Source | Resolved lead source (from UTM or detection) |
| Funnel | Resolved funnel name |
| Page | Page URL path where the event occurred |
| Match | Match level badge (diamond/golden/silver/bronze/unmatched) |
| Lead | Shows "created" badge when a lead was generated from this event (`createdLeadId`) |
| Status | Detection status (detected count / matched / unresolved) |

### Inline Corrections

From the event detail panel, users can create corrections that feed back into detection:

- **Source/Funnel Correction**: Creates a `lead_source_alias` or `funnel_alias` from the event's raw values, so future events with the same raw source/funnel are automatically resolved
- **Field Mapping Correction**: Creates a `field_mapping_rule` for the event's page URL and form, so future submissions from the same form are correctly detected

### System Health Panel

The Attribution page includes a system health panel showing:
- Tracker heartbeat status per tenant (last seen, domain, healthy/inactive)
- Total attribution event count
- Google Sheet config count and sync status
